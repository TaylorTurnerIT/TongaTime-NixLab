    This fetches certs using DNS challenge so we don't need open ports

    Caddy is known to handle HTTPS automatically, but requires a ping to Let's Encrypt. Using DNS challenge with Cloudflare allows us to get wildcard certs without exposing ports.

    Why wildcard?
      Easier management of multiple subdomains
      Future-proofing for adding more services

    Why Caddy?
      Popularity and ease of use

    Why Cloudflare?
      Reliable DNS provider with good API support for DNS challenges
      Cheap!
